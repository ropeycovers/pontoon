# Prontoon

Expermintal nodejs command line Pontoon (Vingt-Un) card game.

The experimental part is that all the code here does not use any of the following statements:
```if```, ```for```, ```while```, ```switch```, ```class```,
and that functions are pure (do not mutate their inputs or have 
other side effects except when writing to or reading the command line UI).
